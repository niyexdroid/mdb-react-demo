# React Demo for MDB

## Prereqs

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (but npm will probably work too)
* Python (but you can do something more involved if you want)

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```sh
$ yarn
```

## Running

Bundle and serve dependencies:
```sh
$ yarn serve-assets
```

In a separate tab, in this project's root directory, with Python 2.x:
```sh
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Or, with Python 3:
```sh
$ python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Open [the app](http://localhost:3000/index.html).

## Resources

* This repo :P
* [React Quick Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
* [React Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) (not super advanced)
* [React Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)

Read those docs a couple of times and you'll be in good shape.
